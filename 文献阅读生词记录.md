1. Genes are **perpetually** added to and deleted from genomes during evolution.
   1. perpetually: 永久地；in a way that never ends or changes; constantly；

2. Thus, it is important to understand how new genes are formed and how they evolve to be **critical components** of the genetic systems that determine the **biological diversity** of life.

   1. critical:关键的

      > 1.  to be critical to … 对…至关重要
      >
      > 2. to be of critical importance极为重要

   2. component(factor):要素
   3. diversity:多样性；the diversity in education

3. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the **peculiar** structures, functions, and evolution of evolutionarily new genes have attracted the interests of pioneers in genetics and evolution since the early twentieth century.

   1. peculiar；特有的；particular; special: *any attempt to explicate the theme is bound to run into peculiar difficulties*.

4. **Regrettably**, we can only choose a few representative publications to **sketch** several lines of observation that can provide insight into an emerging, global picture of new gene evolution.

   1. regrettable;令人遗憾的
   2. sketch ;简要说明：give a brief account or general outline of something；*they sketched out the prosecution case*.

5. Various evolutionary forces, such as natural selection and genetic drift, govern the spread of the **protogene** through the population, thus making protogene **fixation** a **population genetic process.**

   1. protogene;原型基因，也就是新基因形成之前的前体基因。
   2. fixation ;n.固定； the action or process of fixing or being fixed； the process by which some plants and microorganisms assimilate nitrogen or carbon dioxide: *his work on nitrogen **fixation** in plants*.
   3. population genetic process 种群遗传过程

6. Both before and after fixation, the protogene accumulates mutations that **confer on it new structures and beneficial**, sometimes novel, **functions** that are **acted on by** natural selection

   1. confer；授予；**confer on it new structures and beneficial functions**，给予前体基因一些新的结构与有利的功能；confer on sb. sth. 授予某人某物
   2.  **acted on by**； 受 ...... 影响

7. it is **essentially** the same as most other, older genes in the genome and can be considered a new gene.

   1. **essentially** ;基本上地，这里不是 本质地 这个含义

8. **Syntenic alignments** (Figure 1) of genomes can be used to identify new genes from related species for which we know the phylogenetic relationships

   1. Syntenic:(of genes) occurring on the same chromosome: *syntenic sequences*.
      1. biologists usually refer to **synteny** as the **conservation of blocks of order** **within two sets of chromosomes that are being compared with each other**. This concept can also be referred to as [shared synteny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synteny#Shared_synteny).  **也就是两个物种的两条染色体上保守的同方向（5->3）的区域块叫做synteny**或者说两条染色体之间的共同区域（方向序列相同的）
      2.  Syntenic alignments 也就是对两个物种间的染色体进行比对，寻找保守的同向的区域块，也就是shared systeny。shared systeny 可以用于**确定多个物种间的基因组区域的同源性**，**极度保守的systeny可以反映这些区域之间基因的基因组所具备的重要功能关系**![image-20210904154218719](https://tf-picture-bed-1259792641.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/blog/2021-09-04-074219.png)
      3. wiki见：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synteny

9. In these comparisons, a gene can be defined as a new gene candidate if it is present in a certain **clade** or single species and absent in all outgroup species

   1. clade:a group of organisms believed to comprise all the evolutionary descendants of a common ancestor，也就是系统发育树里面某个枝丫下面的所有物种叫做clade

10. **exhaustive** pairwise comparisons between all annotated genes in that genome.

    1. **exhaustive** 详细的，全面的，彻底的

11. RNA-based duplication (retrogenes) most often lack introns, contain a stretch of adeninenucleotide at their 3` end, and contain a pair of short **flanking** direct repeats.

    1. flank ;v.位于......两侧；be on each or on one side of
    2. flanking 位于两侧的

12. It is desirable to predict whether candidate new genes are functional before beginning more **laborious** functional and phenotypic analyses

    1. laborious ;艰巨的；requiring considerable time and effort

13. New genes must acquire a specific transcription regulatory system to ensure certain **temporal** and **spatial** expression patterns.

    1. **temporal**；时间的；relating to time: *the **spatial** and **temporal** dimensions of human interference in complex ecosystems*.
    2. **spatial**；空间的；relating to or occupying space: *the **spatial** distribution of population*.

14. Additionally, Ni et al. (107) observed that eight new genes essential for **Drosophila** development evolved binding sites for the CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) **insulator** under positive selection, ensuring the **delineation** of the regulatory domains of these genes.

    1. Drosophil；果蝇的一种
    2. insulator ；隔绝物？？？
    3. **delineation** ；解释；the action of describing or portraying something precisely: *the artist's exquisite **delineation** of costume and jewellery*.

15. This **co-opted** mode of promoter recruitment is also observed in human retrogenes (144) and may be a general mode for retrogene promoter gain

    1. **co-opt**；增选，得到？；appoint to membership of a committee or other body by invitation of the existing members: *the committee may co-opt additional members for special purposes*. 

16. For instance, TEs can mediate gene recombination by carrying coding sequences from one part of the genome to another (63, 158) and can **even** themselves be incorporated into existing coding sequences

    1. 奇怪的even用法，不知道！
    2. TE ：Transposable elements ；转座子；**Transcription Units**，转录单元
       1. 转录单元（transcription unit) 是一段从启动子开始至终止子（terminator）结束的DNA序列，RNA聚合酶从转录起点开始沿着模板前进，直到终止子为止，转录出一条RNA链。在细胞中，一个转录单元可以是一个基因，也可以是几个基因。

17. Almada et al. (1) reported a highly significant linear correlation between the gene age and the critical signals to define transcription units in a gene, including the U1 small nuclear **ribonucleoprotein** recognition sites and **polyadenylation** sites (PASs).

    1. **ribonucleoprotein**；核糖核蛋白
    2. **polyadenylation**：多聚腺苷酸
